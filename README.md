## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ [lang]/
â”‚Â Â          â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚Â Â              â”œâ”€â”€ [slug]/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name and its language parameter. 

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. 
Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more. 
Or use `getBlogPosts()` from the `src/content/config.ts` file, which adds the blog_slug key as a property to the collection. This is the slug that will be used in the header, blogs list page and as canonical and alternate URLs. 

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

- Manage translations in `src/i18n/ui.ts`
- Edit home page in `src/pages/index.astro` and multilingual in `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro`
- Edit multilingual pages in `src/pages/[lang]/...`
- Edit site header elements in `src/components/Header.astro`
- Add your name to the footer in `src/components/Footer.astro`
- Discover the blog articles included in ES, EN and FR in `src/pages/[lang]/blog/`
- Customize the general layout of the site in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- Customize the blog post page layout in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
